# Deploying kiki-cockpit

Two artefacts:

| Service | Host | Port | Why this host |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kiki-cockpit-{api,public,admin}` | `electron-server` | 443 (Traefik) | co-located with the eu-kiki gateway `:9300`, public IP, Traefik already there |
| `kiki-collector` | `studio` (Mac M3 Ultra) | 9150 | reads training logs and eval results that live in the user's home dir on studio |

The cockpit API on electron-server polls the collector on studio over Tailscale.
This mirrors the eu-kiki worker pattern: each machine exposes its data over HTTP, no NFS / SSHFS.

---

## DNS

| Record | Type | Mode | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ml.saillant.cc` | CNAME | proxied (orange) | `<TUNNEL_ID>.cfargotunnel.com` |
| `admin.ml.saillant.cc` | A | DNS-only (grey) | electron-server Tailscale IP (`100.78.191.52`) |

The public host goes through Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared` already running on
electron-server, serving every other `*.saillant.cc` subdomain). The tunnel's
ingress must include a rule for `ml.saillant.cc` → `https://localhost:443`
(noTLSVerify: true) — managed in the Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard or via API.

The grey-cloud admin record makes the admin host reachable **only from the tailnet**:
non-members can resolve it but can't route to a `100.64/10` IP. No Traefik IPAllowList
needed. Cloudflare can't proxy a Tailscale-only origin (no public IP), so leaving it
DNS-only is both correct and necessary. Traefik issues its Let's Encrypt cert via
ACME DNS-01 (Cloudflare provider) — works without any inbound public route.

## Cockpit on electron-server

Prerequisites on the host:
- Docker + compose
- External Docker network `traefik` (already there — Traefik 3 is up on `:80`/`:443`)
- Cert resolver `letsencrypt` (or override `TRAEFIK_CERTRESOLVER` in `.env`)

```bash
ssh electron-server
sudo mkdir -p /opt/kiki-cockpit && sudo chown $USER:$USER /opt/kiki-cockpit
cd /opt/kiki-cockpit
gh repo clone L-electron-Rare/kiki-cockpit .
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env                    # then edit
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file deploy/.env up -d --build

# Install the SPA routers (compose labels for these are silently dropped — TBD)
sudo cp deploy/traefik-dynamic/kiki-cockpit.yml \
  /home/electron/lelectron-rare/factory-4-life/traefik/dynamic/
```

Verify:
```bash
curl -I https://ml.saillant.cc                        # 200 from public vitrine
curl -I https://ml.saillant.cc/api/public/healthz     # 200 from API
curl -I https://admin.ml.saillant.cc                  # 200 (only from tailnet)
```

The API container reaches the host's `:9300` gateway via `host.docker.internal`
(Docker provides the `host-gateway` mapping in `extra_hosts`). Tailscale Magic DNS
names (`studio`, `macm1`, `tower`) resolve through the host's resolver.

## Collector on studio

The shipped plist is a **LaunchDaemon** — works on headless Macs (no GUI
session) and bootstraps over SSH with sudo.

Step 1 — over SSH (clone, deps):
```bash
ssh studio
cd ~/Documents/Projets
git clone https://github.com/L-electron-Rare/kiki-cockpit.git    # or rsync from another host
cd kiki-cockpit/deploy/collector
~/.local/bin/uv sync                                              # installs deps in .venv
```

Step 2 — install daemon (sudo password required once):
```bash
sudo cp ~/Documents/Projets/kiki-cockpit/deploy/collector/cc.kiki.collector.plist \
  /Library/LaunchDaemons/
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/cc.kiki.collector.plist
sudo chmod 644       /Library/LaunchDaemons/cc.kiki.collector.plist
sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/cc.kiki.collector.plist
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/cc.kiki.collector
curl http://localhost:9150/healthz       # → {"status":"ok","machine":"studio"}
```

The daemon runs as user `clems` (set via `UserName` in the plist) so logs paths
under `/Users/clems/...` remain readable. Logs go to `/var/log/kiki-collector.log`.

Until step 2 is done, you can run the collector transiently over SSH:
```bash
ssh studio "cd ~/Documents/Projets/kiki-cockpit/deploy/collector && \
  nohup ~/.local/bin/uv run uvicorn kiki_collector.main:app \
    --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9150 > ~/Library/Logs/kiki-collector.log 2>&1 &"
```

From electron-server (over Tailscale):
```bash
curl http://studio:9150/api/v1/training/runs           # → JSON list
```

Override roots if needed:
```bash
launchctl setenv COLLECTOR_TRAINING_LOG_ROOTS '["/Users/clems/Documents/Projets/KIKI-Mac_tunner/logs"]'
```

Container variant (`Dockerfile`) exists for hosts where launchd is not available
(Linux training boxes). Mount the log dirs read-only and expose `:9150`.

The cockpit API uses agent-kiki's exact OpenAI-compatible pattern when proxying chat
(see `cli/src/utils/eu-kiki-default.ts` in agent-kiki) — single endpoint, sentinel API
key, gateway handles routing to the right worker.

---

## Out of scope (next iterations)

- Wire the cockpit API's `services/{training_runs,log_tail,eval_index}.py` to the
  collector HTTP endpoints (replace `Path()` walks with `httpx.get(COCKPIT_COLLECTOR_BASE_URL + ...)`).
  The collector already returns the same JSON shape the local services produce.
- Cockpit-admin: surface `X-Tailscale-User` from Tailscale Serve (or replace the
  header check by an "if you reached this hostname you're in the tailnet" model
  matching the DNS gating used here).
- Image registry (currently builds locally on electron-server). Move to GHCR once
  the `deploy/electron-server` branch is merged.
